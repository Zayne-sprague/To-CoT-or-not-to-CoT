6. Richard is seen engrossed in pre-flight checks located in another section of the plane. (A: cockpit)
7. Tom and Richard discuss painstaking flight procedures. (B: office)

Based on the story, the most likely place Lisa would look to find the flight manual is in the cockpit (A: cockpit). This is because Richard and Tom are both seen going to the cockpit to access the flight manual, and Lisa is seen restocking the passenger seating area with safety booklets, which suggests that she may have previously checked the cockpit for the flight manual. Additionally, the story highlights the importance of the flight manual and safety booklets being easily accessible, which further supports the idea that Lisa would look for the flight manual in the cockpit.
